# Overview

I made this project for the purpose of learning the basics of React.js framework in order to use it on future projects.

I created a simple expense tracking software using React.js, by following along to a Udemy course. This is the software that this course has you build along as the instructor teaches you everything in React.

I wrote this software for the purpose of learning React to use on future projects. I intend on using React for the frontend on a team project web app, and I want to build my own personal portfolio online to represent myself.
